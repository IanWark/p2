After only 20 examples, the learned function is mostly flat with a few sharp peaks and valleys. This is because it has only 20 examples so there is a lot of unexplored territory. The few that have been create sharp rigid peaks or valleys, which appear much higher or lower than all around it compared to the smoother curves of the target function this is because most tiles have not been visited and values have not changed, so they are completely flat. If the input space had been divided into a 11x21 grid of rectangles, the peaks and valleys would be even less wide in the x dimension. This is because you are divided up the input space more finely in the x dimension so each point would have less of an impact in that dimension.
